        <pre>I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
        I want you back, I want you back
            My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
            You're all I had, you're all I had
            At night, when the stars light up my room
            I sit by myself
            Talking to the moon
            Tryna get to you
            In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
            Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
            Oh
            I'm feelin' like I'm famous, the talk of the town
            They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
            But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
            Someone's talking back, yeah, they're talking back, oh
            At night, when the stars light up my room
            I sit by myself
            Talking to the moon
            Tryna get to you
            In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
            Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
            Ah, ah, ah
            Do you ever hear me calling?
            (Ah) oh-oh-oh (ah), oh-oh-oh (ah)
            'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
            Still tryna get to you
            In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
            Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
            Oh
            Oh
            I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
